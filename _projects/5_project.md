In this work, I used periods and magnitude for RR Lyrae stars from the literature to derive new, uniform distance measurements for 39 dwarf galaxies in and around the Local Group. I used Bayesian hierarchical modeling to simultaneously derive the Period-Wesenheit Magnitude-Metallicity (PWZ) relation for each dwarf galaxy, and calibrating the resulting distance measurements using Milky Way RR Lyrae with precise _Gaia_ eDR3 parallaxes. On average, these distance moduli were 2-3 times more precise and 0.05 magnitudes closer than literature values. I developed public code that can be used to incorporate additional data into the model and apply the distance scale to new dwarf galaxies.
